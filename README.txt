Maps
====

generated maps played by Nitro, Yellow, Gravity, Benanaminer... great guys! 

Just grab the maps and store them in your infiniminer folder, start the server and load a map file in the console using the command "load xxyyzz.lvl". 
The level platforms.lvl was generated "by hand" using infinimeditor 0.4 by Sallen & Taron (https://code.google.com/p/infinimeditor/)

have fun
